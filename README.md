# protoceratops-nest-analysis

Reproducible analysis of the Protoceratops nest discovery data from Fastovsky et al.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to replicate and document the key findings from the landmark Fastovsky et al. study on the *Protoceratops* nest. The goal is to make the raw data, analytical methods, and interpretations openly accessible and verifiable by other researchers, serving as an educational module on dinosaur postnatal development.

Specifically, we focus on the analysis of uniform size and developmental stage within the clutch of 15 juvenile Protoceratops, which supports the hypothesis of a single clutch with extended parental care.

## Repository Structure

- `nest_data.csv`: Digitized fossil measurement data (e.g., femur length, skull width) for all 15 juveniles.
- `analysis.py` / `analysis.R`: Scripts to compute descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation) and generate visualizations.
- `interpretation.md`: Discussion of statistical results and their implications for the "single clutch" hypothesis and parental care.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the analysis script on the provided CSV file.
3. Review the interpretation document for contextual insights.
